-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are ????. I chose these to give the site a striking view and maske the text easy to see.
    -   #### Typography
        -  ????????? Vina sans, long cang and winx made for display are the fonts used in this page. Winx made for display font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I like it as it is a clean font and is suitable for all types of content. Vina sans is used in the website name and nav bar options as it is bold, unique and in theory, remembered. Long cang is used for small pieces of text to add a bit of flair and relaxed kind of vibe. 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   ???????Ive tried to use positive imagery throughout the site to make it visually attractive and to keep the visitor engaged. i used a scrolling gallery to really hammer home the beauty of being a single dad.
